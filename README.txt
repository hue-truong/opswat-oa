OPSWAT ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT - JULY 2022 - HUE TRUONG
Using Python 3.8.10 to complete assessment 

Reasoning: 
I am a firm believer in Occam's Razor; in short, the simplest solution
is almost always the best solution. There were multiple approaches that
I could have taken such as creating an entire React.js project, vanilla 
HTML/CSS/JS, or using C++ libcurl, but in this situation I chose Python for
readability and accessibility. Of course there is some overhead using Python 
in terms of efficiency. However, I felt the assessment was small enough where 
ultimately these overheads had minimal effect on the runtime of the solution,
in comparison to using other methods.
